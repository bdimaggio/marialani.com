This is a WordPress repository for marialani.com, the website I built for Jon Lackman to support his & Zachary Pinson's [The Woman With Fifty Faces](https://www.fantagraphics.com/products/the-woman-with-fifty-faces). The only code work was in customizing [Automattic's Dark Academia theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/dark-academia/) to get the right look & feel.
